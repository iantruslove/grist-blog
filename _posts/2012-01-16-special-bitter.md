## Grain Bill

Fermentables:

- 13 lb Maris Otter
- 1/3 lb Victory
- 1/2 lb flaked barley
- 3/4 lb Crystal 75&deg;
- 1 oz black patent

Hops:

- 1 oz East Kent Goldings (FWH)
- 1/2 oz Fuggles (60 mins)
- 1/2 oz Fuggles (30 mins)
- 1 oz East Kent Goldings (3 mins)
- 1 oz Styrian Goldings (whirlpool)

Other:
- 1/2 whirlfloc (15 mins)

Yeast: 

- White Labs WL002 "English Ale"

## Recipe Notes

The recipe is largely taken from Gordon Strong's "Brewing Better Beer".  The grain bill is for 
a no-sparge recipe, but my last brew achieved 47% efficiency in-kettle, so I stuck 
with this grain bill.  (Yeah, 47%.  More on that later.)

152&deg;F mash for 60 mins.  Mash out at 170&deg;F.

75 min boil.  Initial S.G. 1.051, target final S.G. 1.016

## Results

Not too bad.  I don't think it was very much like an English ESB, but it's pretty easy drinking.  




## Brew Notes

### 01/16/2012 (Brew Day)

Water calculations targeted a kettle volume of 6.6 gal, and a mash volume of 
4.4 gal (at 1.2 qt/lb).  I batch sparged, and calculated a first infusion of 
0.25 gal, and a second infusion of 3.3 gal.  

Noting that the 0.25 gal first 
infusion was highly unlikely to raise the mash temp to 170&deg;F, I planned to 
increase the first infusion and decrease the second infusion by 0.5 gals.  In 
retrospect it's obvious, but 0.5 gals of infusion at ~210&deg;F had no noticeable effect 
on the mash temperature.  The mash out began at 152&deg;F.  The second infusion of 
2.8 gals at ~210&deg;F raised the mash temperature to 171&deg;F.  

With the 75 minute boil there were higher evaporative losses than expected.  Towards 
the end of the boil I added a little extra water for a final boil volume of just 
under 5 gallons.  For future brews I think this is where I can account for more water in the 
first infusion to get the mash temperature higher for mash out.

The wort was chilled with the immersion coil down to 80&deg;F, whirlpooled and 
cooled further to 70&deg;F in an ice bath, and a total of 4 gallons were siphoned 
into the primary.  The wort's S.G. was 1.064, so an additional 1 gallon of boiled
water was added to reach the target starting S.G. of 1.051.

The wort was aerated, the yeast pitched, and fermented at ~68&deg;F.
