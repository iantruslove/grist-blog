## Brew Notes
### 11/25/11 (Brew Day)
This was my first all grain brew.  Aiming for 5 gallons after the boil, and 
estimating 13% evaporation loss, water calculations were made for a 5.65 gal 
pre-boil wort volume.  After cooling and syphoning the wort off the trub, I got
a yield of ~4 gals (S.G. 1.073) in the primary...  

### 12/1/11 - Rack to Secondary
Racked off from primary into secondary, adding 1 oz Cascade hops for dry hopping.
S.G. was 1.024, indicating ~6.5% ABV.  Active fermentation hadn't yet finished, 
so it tasted a little yeasty still.

### 12/19/2011 - Clarify and bottling
After a couple of weeks in secondary the fermentation finally looked complete.  
S.G. measured as 1.016.  The beer was quite cloudy, so moved it to the cold garage 
for three days before bottling.  Cooling the beer distinctly helped the clarity.

Priming sugar added and beer was bottled.  At this point the beer was attenuated, 
even dry.  There was a distinct hop bitternes in the finish that I hope will round 
out in the bottle.  Nice fruity yeast nose.

Final yield in bottle: 3.5 gal.

## Process Notes
This was the first all grain batch I brewed, and the first with my MLT.  I estimate 
my process efficiency at 47% - worth considering and trying to improve.  

## Tasting

Not bad at all!  First impression was the really bubbly, bright-white foam.  The
beer is nearly clear.
