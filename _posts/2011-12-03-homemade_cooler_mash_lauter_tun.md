# Intro

I wanted to start all-grain brewing, so I needed to construct a mash tun.  For 5 gallon batches, batch sparging seemed considerably simpler and less error-prone than continuous (fly) sparging, and fabricating a mash/lauter tun from picnic coolers seems fairly common and straightforward.  The parts cost was somewhere around $50, and everything was easy to find at Lowes (the cooler was from Target).  I'll outline what I used and what I did to make my MLT.

Parts
----

* 52 qt cooler (with drain tap)
* 1/2" CPVC pipe [10']
* 1/2" Right-angle CPVC connectors [x6]
* 1/2" T CPVC connectors [5]
* CPVC cement
* 1/2" CPVC to 1/2" ID brass connector
* 1/2" rubber O-ring
* 1/2" ID stainless washer
* 1/2" brass ball valve
* 1/2" brass hose connector

Having a cooler with a drain tap definitely made construction easier.  The tap was punched through in a small uninsulated section of the cooler, so there is no bulkhead to reinforce.  The tap unscrewed easily, and provided me with some usefully-sized washers and parts.

Planning
------

I chose to construct the drain system from a matrix of CPVC tubes versus a stainless steel braid.  It seemed that it would be easier to clean, and would fill the bottom of a large rectangular cooler better.  I can also glue the ends of the manifold and leave the longer parts unglued, to allow easy disassembly for cleaning.  To prevent your homebrew from killing you, use *CPVC, not PVC*. They are the cream-colored tubes at the diy store.  

An appendix in Palmer's [How To Brew](http://www.howtobrew.com/appendices/appendixD-1.html) gives some guidance on sizing and placement of the drainage tubes.  I planned on having four tubes aligned lengthways, each with drainage holes.  Manifolds on each end would allow free flow between the long tubes.  This gave me enough information to plan and purchase all the parts from the store.

I laid out the parts in the bottom of the cooler and it became apparent that a dog-leg would be necessary, and that the various connectors would have to be shortened to allow the fit and shape I wanted.

Construction
-------

![Cut the corner](/assets/images/2011-12-03/cut_corner_480.JPG "Cut the corner")

I used a dremel to shorten the corner and T pieces, and measured to make sure center distances were what I needed:

Cut small connecting pieces for the manifold from a length of CPVC, carefully de-burring and sanding all edges.  To make sure you didn't do something wrong, dry-fit the parts and pop them into the cooler.  Once I was happy with all the parts and fit, I glued the connectors with CPVC cement, and moved on to the long tubes.

![All parts](/assets/images/2011-12-03/all_parts_480.JPG "All parts")

I cut the long lengths of tube, and cut slots through about half the tube height at 1" intervals.  I used a small wad of sandpaper and a length of dowel to de-burr the insides of the tubes.

This didn't remove the burrs completely, but a stiff scrubbing brush took care of the remainder.  As planned, I did not glue the long tubes into the manifold.

Initial Results
--------

The first batch (a [Farmhouse Ale](/2011/11/25/prairie_farmhouse_ale.html)) went well.  I preheated the MLT with a couple of gallons of boiling water and wrapped the bottom and sides of the cooler with heavy blankets.  Despite temperatures just above freezing the mash held its temperature to within a degree for a 1 hour mash.  At sparge time I had the ball valve fully open, and there was a fast drain and no stuck sparge.  I left the tap open once I began the main boil and I did collect a small amount more wort, but definitely not much.

Planned Changes
--------

So far the only improvement I can see to make is to drill some drainage holes in the manifolds, especially at the tap end.  The cooler has to be tipped to get the last dregs out, and there is definitely some small volume of wort that some extra holes would allow me to drain off.
