The second apple cider experiment was inspired by an old batch of mead James
and I made.  I had read about various variants of cider, including cyser - a
cider brewed with honey (or a mead brewed with apple juice, depending on which
way you look at it).

Mead takes a while, so I procured a 3 gallon glass carboy for the fermentation.
Additionally, my LHBS had some Orange Blossom honey on hand, and I thought that
would make a nice contribution.

## Ingredients

* 2.5 gal raw cider (SG 1.044)
* 3 lb Orange blossom honey
* 1 pack Red Star [Pasteur champagne yeast][yeast]

## Process

Boiled 1 qt water and dissolved honey.  Cooled, and added to apple juice.  Rehydrated yeast and pitched into glass primary.  Original SG 1.080.
