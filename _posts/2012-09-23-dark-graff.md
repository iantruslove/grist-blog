The final batch of cider needed to be the weirdest, and hopefully this will do.
Graff is a type of beer inspired by a Steven King novel, though my inspiration
came more from [Homebrewtalk][hbt graff].  This recipe is based on one of the
darker recipes, and dark it will be.  I added a tiny amount of smoked malt too,
hoping that will be slightly detectable.

The process was a mini-mash extract beer process, with the raw cider thrown in
at the end.

## Specifications

60 min boil

## Brew Notes 

### 2012-09-23 (Brew Day)

Heated 1.5 gallons of water to 160&deg;F, and added a grain bag containing the
crushed grains.  The temperature dropped to 155&deg;F, and the pot was placed
in a warm oven for 30 mins.

Meanwhile, another 2.5 gals water were brought to the boil.  The LME was
dissolved and the runnings from the minimash (~1.25 gals) were added.  The wort
was brought back to the boil and skimmed until the hot break.  Hops were added
in hop bags per the boil schedule.

After flamout, the wort was cooled with an immersion coil, and rehydrated yeast
was pitched.

Original SG 1.048 @ 75&deg;F.
