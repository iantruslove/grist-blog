A couple of Google searches led me to a couple of posts on HomeBrewTalk about a "Kentucky Common" style of beer.  Apparently it's one of two truly American styles of beer (the other being the much better known California Common, popularized by Anchor Steam), and ODaniel's posts indicated a slightly soured mash.  Nice!  [This](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f12/kentucky-common-sourness-126826/) and [this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f66/kiss-yer-cousin-rye-kentucky-common-ale-290419/) are what I based my recipe on, and have some interesting comments on the style.

Unfortunately I couldn't get Cluster hops, and they seem to be fairly representative in the recipes online I found.  Northern Brewer's what I had to hand.

Worth noting is that the grain bill plus a couple of extra bits came to a little over $30, making this the cheapest (all-grain) batch I've brewed to date.


## Grain Bill

Fermentables:

- 6lb American pale 6-row
- 0.25lb Crystal 120L
- 0.25lb black patent malt
- 1lb flaked corn (maize)
- 1lb flaked rye


Hops:

- 0.5 oz Northern Brewer (FWH)
- 0.5 oz Northern Brewer (25 min)
- 0.5 oz Northern Brewer (10 min)

Other:

- ???

Yeast: 

- White Labs WL002 "English Ale"

## Recipe Notes


Target 154&deg;F mash for 60 mins.  Mash out at 170&deg;F.

After the mash, add a handful of grain to the liquor and let it sit at (100F?) for 24 hours.  The various Lactobacillus bugs in the raw grain will start to sour the beer.  

60 min boil.  Target original S.G. 1.045, target final S.G. 1.016


For the boil, I got a handful of muslin hop bags to try to reduce the amount of wort loss in trub.
