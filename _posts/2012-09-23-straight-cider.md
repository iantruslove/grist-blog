With the glut of apple juice, the first experiment was just to try a simple
fermented cider.  Previous ciders have turned out very dry, so the aim with
this was to create a slightly sweeter, lower-alcohol cider.

## Ingredients

* 4.5 gal raw cider
* 1 pack [Lalvin EC-1118][Lalvin]
* 1 campden tablet

## Process

Rehydrated yeast and added to cider (original SG 1.044).  

After 5 days obvious fermentation activity had ceased; on 9/30 SG was down to
1.002, and the crushed campden tablet was added.
