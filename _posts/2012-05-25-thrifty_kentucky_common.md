A couple of Google searches led me to a couple of posts on HomeBrewTalk about a "Kentucky Common" style of beer.  Apparently it's one of two truly American styles of beer (the other being the much better known California Common, popularized by Anchor Steam), and ODaniel's posts indicated a slightly soured mash.  Nice!  [This](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f12/kentucky-common-sourness-126826/) and [this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f66/kiss-yer-cousin-rye-kentucky-common-ale-290419/) are what I based my recipe on, and have some interesting comments on the style.

Unfortunately I couldn't get Cluster hops, and they seem to be fairly representative in the recipes online I found.  Northern Brewer's what I had to hand.

Worth noting is that the grain bill plus a couple of extra bits came to a little over $30, making this the cheapest (all-grain) batch I've brewed to date.

## Brew Notes

### 05/30/2012 (Brew Day)

I tried to nail down a couple more weak spots in my process, both related to efficiency.  I've noticed lots of trub post-whirlpool, and in general poor extraction efficiency.  

Hop bags really helped with reducing trub - hop additions go into the boil in the normal way, except instead of throwing the hops in directly, they go in a small muslin bag.  

Something I have consistently not hit properly in previous mashes was the rinse temperature.  Adding a small amount of water at boiling to 3 gals of 150F water doesn't do a whole lot to raise the mash temp to 170F.  This time I tried draining the MLT *before* adding my first infusion.  This really helped - I raised the grist to 165F before draining for the second time.  The second infusion went in after that, raising the grist to 180F.

I also ended up with an (unplanned) 2 hour mash.  During the brew I wasn't really hitting the target mash temperatures I was after, so a couple of times I pulled off a 2 pint decoction, boiled it in a small pan, and re-added to the mash.  By the time I started draining, 2 hours had passed...

I can't identify exactly what caused what, but I ended up extracting at 91% into the kettle, with total brewhouse efficiency being 83%.
