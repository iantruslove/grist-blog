# TODO

* Install and use `kramdown` and configure auto code highlighting
* Configure vim to treat liquid code blocks as code blocks - e.g. try adding some clojure to a markdown page...
* Configure vim to handle the yaml front matter
* Pull in all content from the nanoc version
* Figure out permalinks - need to make sure all resources on the old site are still either directly available, or redirected
* Layout:
  * Nice typeface, nice spacing
  * ? Single column layout - maximise the reading room
* Post layout
  * Put the post metadata into a nice little box on the right, out of the main flow
  * "Tagged with" metadata, each linked to a tags page for that tag
* Front page:
  * Popular posts box (content to highlight)
  * Recent tweets box
  * Recent comments box

# Done

* Add prev and next links on the post template
