# About This Site

This is my brewing and beer blog.  It had  been a while before 2011 that I had
done much homebrewing.  I picked it back up, jumping straight into all-grain
brews, and started playing around to see if I can't make some brews to rival
the excellent craft breweries here in Colorado.
